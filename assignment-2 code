\maketitle

\begin{summary}
Gödel’s two incompleteness theorems are among the most important results in modern logic, and have deep implications for various issues. They concern the limits of provability
in formal axiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that in any consistent formal system 
F
 within which a certain amount of arithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of 
F
 which can neither be proved nor disproved in 
F
. According to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal system cannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it is indeed consistent).
These results have had a great impact on the philosophy of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to apply the results also in other areas of philosophy
such as the philosophy of mind, but these attempted applications are more controversial. The present entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems and various issues
surrounding them.
